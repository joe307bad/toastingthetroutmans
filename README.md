## ToastingTheTroutmans
### A wedding website built with [React](https://reactjs.org/)

#### Tehnical Features:
* [React Spring](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring) for animation and parallax effect
* [Stylus](https://github.com/stylus/stylus) as a robust, expressive styling language that compiles to CSS
* [JSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jss) for integrating a theme/styles the "React way" (inline) and maintaining a DRY method of implementing media queries (mobile first responsiveness)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a high level of structure and strong typing
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle assets and run a live reloading dev server
